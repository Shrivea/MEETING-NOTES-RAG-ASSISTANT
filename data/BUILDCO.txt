Discovery Call Notes - BuildCo Inc.

Jane Martinez (Marketing Director)

Early stage - they just started looking at solutions last week.
Company has ~200 employees but only marketing team needs this 
(about 30 seats to start).

What they're dealing with:
- Manual reporting takes forever  
- No good way to track campaigns
- Team is frustrated with current spreadsheet mess

Jane liked the demo! Wants to show her CMO and team lead.
Budget isn't approved yet - she thinks Q2 implementation timeline.

She asked for:
- Product overview deck
- Case studies (specifically B2B marketing teams)
- Pricing estimate for 30 seats

Competition: mentioned they're also looking at ToolA and ToolB

Not super urgent but she seems genuinely interested. Good fit for 
our mid-market segment.

Next steps: send materials by next week, follow up in 2 weeks to 
see if she's had internal discussions
