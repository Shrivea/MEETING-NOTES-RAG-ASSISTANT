Follow-up w/ TechStart - Mike Patterson

Good call today! They're ready to expand from 20 seats to 100 
next quarter. Been using us for 8 months, really happy with the 
product - Mike said "best decision we made last year."

Key points:
- Finance approval needed for anything over $50K
- Mike will intro me to CFO Linda Chen next week
- Current pricing: $30/seat, asked if we can do $25/seat for 100
- Want rollout complete by Feb 15 (new hires starting)
- Also interested in API access (didn't know we had it!)

Their timeline:
- Decision by Jan 25
- Implementation in Feb
- Full rollout mid-Feb

TODO:
[] Send expansion proposal with bulk pricing
[] Calculate ROI doc showing their savings so far
[] Schedule 3-way call w/ Mike + Linda (next Tues/Wed)
[] Send API documentation

Deal feels solid - Mike is our champion there.
