dataflow systems - marcus johnson

CALL WENT GREAT!!!

marcus = CTO, 75 seats needed for eng + ops teams
theyre BLEEDING time right now - team wastes 4 hours/day (!!) on 
data entry & manual processes

timeline is TIGHT - he wants to onboard by end of month
budget approved already - $60k range
mentioned theyre also talking to our competitor (didnt say who)

Technical requirements:
- API integrations w/ their internal tools
- SSO (they use Okta)
- custom reporting dashboards
- needs to handle 10k+ records/day

he asked: "can you do a technical proof-of-concept this week?"

TODO asap:
- schedule technical deep-dive w/ their eng team (this week!)

- get solutions architect on next call
- pricing proposal by tuesday

This is a HOT lead - marcus has authority to sign, budget ready, 
pain is urgent. DONT LOSE THIS ONE.
