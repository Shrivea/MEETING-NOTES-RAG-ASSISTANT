Q1 Check-in - NexGen Solutions - Rebecca Torres

Quarterly business review with Rebecca (Customer Success Manager there).
They've been with us for 14 months, currently 45 seats.

Usage stats look great:
- Active users up 30% this quarter
- Logged 2,400+ hours in the platform last month  
- Only 2 support tickets (both minor)

Renewal coming up in March - no concerns there, Rebecca confirmed 
they're definitely renewing.

UPSELL OPPORTUNITY:
Their product team (15 people) wants access too! Rebecca asked about:
1. Adding 15 more seats
2. Upgrading to Enterprise tier for advanced analytics
3. Dedicated training session for new users

Also - she mentioned they'd be open to doing a video testimonial / 
case study. Great PR opportunity!

Timeline:
- Upsell decision by mid-Feb
- Renewal auto-renews March 12 unless we hear otherwise

Next steps:
[] Send proposal for +15 seats + Enterprise upgrade
[] Schedule demo of Enterprise features for product team
[] Coordinate w/ marketing on case study (not urgent)
[] Send renewal reminder 30 days before (mid-Feb)

Low risk, high satisfaction account. Good expansion potential.
